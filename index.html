								<h2>1) Carrier Global Corporation (1+ Years) </h2>
								<p><h3> Tenure:</h3>
								<u>Role</u>: Manufacturing Engineering Co-Op<br>
								<u>Company</u>: Carrier (HVAC)<br>
								<u>Timeline</u>: August 2024 - December 2024<br>
								<u> Location</u>: Franklin, Kentucky<br>
								<u>Description</u>: Previously <I> (Precision Tubes) </I> -- now directly supplies low OD tubes to be assembled in heat pumps and AC units at the Tennessee plant. The work might seem easy on the outside but the complexity which goes on in producing high quality tubes is immense. The plant converts thin sheet metals which undergoes several operations such as high frequency induction welding and a series of speed and tension variation to create miles of tubes in minutes.</p>
								<u>Role</u>: Supply Chain and Manufacturing Associate<br>
								<u>Company</u>: Carrier (HVAC)<br>
								<u>Timeline</u>: June 2025 - Current<br>
								<u> Location</u>: Indianapolis, Indiana<br>
								<u>Description</u>: Previously <I> (UTC) </I> -- now an independent company producing 80% and 90% efficiency gas furnaces.</p>
								<p> I am currently working with supply chain and manufacturing to build innovative solutions and improve processes in the plant as part of the operations leadership program.</p>
								
								<p>One of my main outcomes in the Indy plant was improving process in the replacement component department and warehouse handling by applying Lean principles to stabilize flow and improve delivery performance. I deployed an AI-assisted scheduling platform to align customer demand with production capacity, strengthen coordination across manufacturing, operations, and supply chain, and reduce planning variability. Through detailed analysis of material flow, production constraints, and demand patterns, I improved planning accuracy and ensured reliable execution against program schedules. This experience strengthened my ability to manage complex programs end-to-end, balancing technical feasibility with cost, timing, and deployment risk while driving aligned execution across cross-functional teams.</p>
								<p> At the Franklin plant I worked with the manufacturing engineering team. My role focused on driving cross-team execution, coordinating design validation, deploying sensor-based monitoring systems, and ensuring hardware solutions transitioned smoothly into operational use. I managed engineering dependencies, tracked program risks, and delivered multiple system redesign improvements that increased production efficiency by 23% and generated over $140K in annualized savings. I gained deep exposure to manufacturing equipment design review and data-driven process performance evaluation -- all while maintaining structured project schedules and meeting every committed deadline. I also standardized work procedures and led 5S improvements with production teams to improve onboarding and process efficiency.</p>
								<p><u>Skills Developed </u>:
									3D CAD modeling (SolidWorks, CREO), GD&T and tolerance reasoning, NPI design integration, failure analysis, process improvement, prototype design, AI-assisted planning, schedule coordination, data analytics, cross-functional program execution, and stakeholder alignment.
								</p>
								<p> <u>Management Expertise </u>:
									Project management, operations strategy, supply chain optimization, process mapping, Lean Six Sigma principles, stakeholder communication, report outs, and team leadership.
								</p>

								<h2>2) Wabash National Corporation (10 months)</h2>
								<p><h3> Tenure:</h3>
								<u>Role</u>: Product Development Engineering Co-Op<br>
								<u>Company</u>: Wabash National (Trailer Manufacturing)<br>
								<u>Timeline</u>: November 2023 - August 2024<br>
								<u> Location</u>: Lafayette, Indiana<br>
								<u>Description</u>: Wabash focusses on manufacturing innovative composite material trailers for whole of North America. </p>
								<p> During my time at Wabash National, I worked as a co-op with the product development engineering supporting design validation, system readiness, and cross-functional execution for new trailer designs. My role focused on bridging product management, engineering, and suppliers to ensure designs were technically sound, manufacturable, and ready to scale. I directed multiple design-validation efforts from early concept through prototype and pre-production, coordinating test timelines, reviewing mechanical designs, and validating performance against functional and durability requirements.</p>
								<p> I was actively involved in GD&T reviews, tolerance reasoning, and packaging studies to ensure assemblies met quality and manufacturability standards. I also collaborated closely with suppliers on material and design changes, balancing performance, cost, and lead-time considerations. One of my key contributions included prototyping and testing a rivet-less track design that reduced fastener count and improved structural durability under load. Across these programs, I maintained clear schedules, tracked risks, and supported disciplined decision-making to enable smooth transitions into pre-production.</p>
							    <p> <u>Skills Developed </u>:
									Design for Manufacturing (DFM), 3D CAD modeling (SolidWorks), GD&T and tolerance analysis, design validation, prototype testing, supplier collaboration, cross-functional coordination, and mechanical system design.	
								</p>
							    <span class="image main"><img src="images/wabash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>3) Hyundai Motor Company (3 Months) </h2>
								<p><h3> Tenure:</h3>
								<u>Role</u>: Manufacturing Engineering Intern<br>
								<u>Company</u>: Hyundai Motor Company (Automotive Manufacturing)<br>
								<u>Timeline</u>: June 2022 - August 2022<br>
								<u> Location</u>: Tamil Nadu, India<br>
								<u>Description</u>: Global manufacturing for automotive components.</p>
								<p> I worked as an intern with the manufacturing engineering team during my senior year during my bachelors. I worked closely with the manufacturing engineering and R&D team on engine development and exhaust emission analysis. My primary focus was identifying and mitigating manufacturing and design risks through structured failure analysis. I led the development of a detailed DFMEA covering 11+ potential safety and reliability risks associated with engine components and manufacturing processes. Working closely with R&D, manufacturing, and quality engineers, I analyzed failure modes, assessed severity and occurrence, and proposed corrective actions to reduce risk before production. </p>
								<p> I supported cross-functional discussions between design, production, and quality teams, gaining insight into how large-scale automotive manufacturing environments manage technical trade-offs and production readiness.</p>
								<p> <u>Skills Developed </u>:
									Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), mechanical design analysis, manufacturing process evaluation, cross-functional collaboration, and thermal systems engineering, and engineering simulations.
